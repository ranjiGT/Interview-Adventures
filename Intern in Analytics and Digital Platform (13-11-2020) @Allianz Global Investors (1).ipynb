    "- Two interviewers were there who gave a brief introduction to the projects and ongoings at this position. It was based on Munich.\n",
    "- They reviewed the Cover letter and confirmed the fact check.\n",
    "- I started with my introduction... and why for this position.\n",
    "- They asked questions related to Python such as what is `PEP8` in Python, where do you look up for coding in Python (eg. sources), Basic data types in Python, features of Python.\n",
    "- They asked about certain ML algorithms that I used in my projects. How do you rate the performance of your models.\n",
    "- Aksed about **k-means** algorithm. The Pseudocode and how it basically works and how it should be implemented in Python.\n",
    "- Would you use only model in production or collection of models in production and why would you do that? Explain the rationale.\n",
    "- How do you initialize the clusters in kmeans (I said... by **kmeans++**)."
